# Description

This is my portfolio site. I have several of my projects in the projects carousel.
These are my more recent projects focusing on the React/Node stack.

I have older projects using Django and Python available on github.

I chose to build this portfolio site with the only library being React. There is one package I used for smooth scrolling, but all the CSS is custom built, including the carousel in the projects section.

The carousel uses custom CSS animations I created.

## More about me

If you have looked this far into my code, please allow me to describe myself in a little more detail.

I am currently a Front End Developer. Though I have previously been a fire fighter, a social worker, and a teacher. I have fallen in love with coding. Other than spending time with my family, it's what I most enjoy doing. I do have other hobbies that are currently on the back burner, such as photography and woodworking, both of which I have self-studied.

Having spent over a decade as a science teacher, the "why" is very important to me. I enjoy learning the fundamentals and trying to incorporate best practices as I learn them.

-   From the rule of thirds in photography, to proper joinery techniques in woodworking like box-joints, mortise and tenon joints, and finishing techniques, I love to learn it all.
-   Programming is no different, however the level of complexity is wonderful. What I enjoy most about programming is that I am uncomfortable. It makes me question myself constantly. One moment I feel like I will never understand how to solve a problem, and the next I'm extatic beause I have figured out a working solution.

The Review Game identified in my projects list is what initially got me into programming 4 years ago. I made a game with cards for my science students and I saw too many shy or slower students struggling to be a part of the fast paced competition, so I thought I could make it a digital game where they could drag the pieces into the correct spots and it would keep score.

Obviously this "simple" idea had a lot more to it, and now I find myself learning, watching, practicing, and reading about programming and web development all the time.
